Purpose of this page
------------
This page should provide you with the tools to:
- Extract genes from *Calliarthron* (using annotations from KEGG analysis)
- Extract whole metabolic pathways from *Calliarthron* (using the pathview package (1))
- Identify *Calliarthron* sequences with genome support

Introduction
------------
*Calliarthron* is a coralline red algae whoes transcriptome and genome have been recently sequenced. The trasncriptomic data has been annotated with [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html). Here we provide a method for extracting genes directly.
